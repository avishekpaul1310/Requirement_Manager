# Contributing to ReqManager

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/reqmanager/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/reqmanager/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Share the exact commands you used
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation
* Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python
* Keep functions and methods focused and short
* Write meaningful variable and function names
* Add docstrings to classes and methods

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:
- Run all tests: `python manage.py test`
- Ensure 100% of existing tests pass
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
  - üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
  - üé® `:art:` when improving structure/format
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` when refactoring
  - üöÄ `:rocket:` when improving performance
